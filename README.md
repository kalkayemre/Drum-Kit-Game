<p>I've builded this project when i was learning JS key-button attractions. Each key has different drum audio so users can play their own melody.</p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>Each drum plays diffrent sound, Users must've hit the buttons to get the noice. Or they can click into pictures as a second alternative.</p>
